<p class="mx-8">Tragedy struck at Idumoza Community, Uromi, Esan North-East Local Government Area of Edo State, as a hotel under construction collapsed and k!lled its owner identified as Harrison Isesere. <br><br>
Eyewitnesses said the building collapsed last Friday, August 1, 2025 while the owner was inside.<br><br>
Over 20 other workers at the hotel site escaped d3ath by the whiskers.
Isesere's remains were only pulled out of the rubble on Sunday morning.<br><br>
According to neighbours who spoke to journalists, the deceased was cautioned during construction about the quality of materials used for the construction. <br>
“The owner was told he was using low-quality material. He used 12mm instead of 16mm rods for the pillars. There was no base basket at the pillars. Look at the result,” One of the neighbours, Andrew Inegbebor, said<br><br>
“The building collapsed because of substandard materials that were used. There was no engineer on site. The dead owner supervised the house. The house later collapsed and k!lled the owner, but some workers escaped."</p>
